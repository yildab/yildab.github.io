      <description>I am a first-year Master&amp;rsquo;s student in physics and astronomy at Queen&amp;rsquo;s University. I am supervised by Dr. Joseph Bramante, within the Queen&amp;rsquo;s High Energy and Astroparticle Theory Group (QHEAT).
I graduated with a BSc in mathematical physics from the University of Waterloo in 2020.
I enjoy taking part in science outreach programs, especially ones aiming to promote interest in science to primary and secondary school students, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM.</description>
