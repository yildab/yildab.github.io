      <description>I am a second-year Master&amp;rsquo;s student in physics and astronomy at Queen&amp;rsquo;s University. I am supervised by Dr. Joseph Bramante, within the Queen&amp;rsquo;s High Energy and Astroparticle Theory group (QHEAT).
My research interests centre around dark matter theory and phenomenology.
I graduated with a BSc in mathematical physics from the University of Waterloo in 2020, minoring in astrophysics and pure mathematics.
I am passionate about science outreach, especially programs aiming to promote interest in science to primary and secondary school students, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, the IDEAS Initiative in collaboration with Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk Science at Queen&amp;rsquo;s University ran Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk Astrophysics, a high school symposium about astrophysics. The event was incredibly successful, with over 300 unique participants. The symposium was aimed towards fostering Canadian high school students to have an interest in advancing into the natural sciences while exposing them to a maximally diverse set of volunteer physicists.
