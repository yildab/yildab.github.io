I am a first-year Master's student in physics and astronomy at Queen's University. I am supervised by Dr. Joseph Bramante, within the Queen's High Energy and Astroparticle Theory Group (QHEAT).

I graduated with a BSc in mathematical physics from the University of Waterloo in 2020.

I enjoy taking part in science outreach programs, especially ones aiming to promote interest in science to primary and secondary school students, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, watercolour, and learning languages!
