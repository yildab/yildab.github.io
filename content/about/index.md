I am a second-year PhD student in astroparticle physics at Queen's University. I am supervised by Dr. Joseph Bramante and am part of the Queen's High 
Energy and Astroparticle Theory group ([QHEAT](https://www.queensu.ca/academia/bramante/qheat-group)). My research interests centre around dark matter 
phenomenology, and in particular, direct and indirect detection 
signatures of heavy dark matter.

I graduated with a BSc in mathematical physics from the University of Waterloo in 2020, minoring in astrophysics and pure mathematics.

I am passionate about science outreach, especially programs aiming to promote interest in science to primary and secondary school students, as well as 
promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM. I am currently the Director of Operations of the [IDEAS Initiative](https://www.queensu.ca/physics/ideas), a 
volunteer organization aiming to encourage the advancement of under-represented groups in physics, through science programming for youth.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, crocheting and learning about languages!
