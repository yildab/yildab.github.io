I am a first-year Master's student in physics and astronomy at Queen's University. I am supervised by Dr. Joseph Bramante, within the Queen's High Energy and Astroparticle Theory group (QHEAT), with research interests centring around dark matter phenomenology. 

I graduated with a BSc in mathematical physics from the University of Waterloo in 2020, minoring in astrophysics and pure mathematics.

I am passionate about science outreach, especially programs aiming to promote interest in science to primary and secondary school students, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, watercolour, and learning languages!
