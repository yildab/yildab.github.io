> Last weekend, the IDEAS Initiative in collaboration with Let's Talk Science 
at Queen's University ran Let's Talk Astrophysics, a high school symposium 
about astrophysics. The event was incredibly successful, with over 300 
unique participants. The symposium was aimed towards fostering Canadian 
high school students to have an interest in advancing into the natural 
sciences while exposing them to a maximally diverse set of volunteer physicists.
